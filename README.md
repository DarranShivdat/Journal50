The first step to using Journal50 is registering for an account. You must provide an unique username, a password,
and the same password again to confirm. Once that is completed your login information is saved to the database and you
are redirected to the home page. The home page includes the reasons behind journaling and a little information about
me, the creator, Darran Shivdat.
The next feature is the journaling feature. This feature allows you to reflect on your day and write openly.
You are prompted with a few questions to keep in mind which should guide you to a positive journal entry.
The questions are prompted to focus on the positives which should impriove the mood of the user.
You must fill in a title and the journaling section.
Once completing journaling, there are seven questions that must be completed. These questions were inspired
by tests such as the PHQ-9 or the GAD-7 (mood tests). You must put a number from 1-10 in response to the question.
For example you may want to rate your day as a ten as being an incredible day or a one as a horrible day. When you have
completed all of the questions you can hit the submit button.

Once submitting, your responses are recorded and you can access them in the history tab. You are automatically
redirected here after submitting. This page contains a table with three columns: Time, Title and DRA.
The time section shows the time you submitted the entry. The title is a link of the Title of the entry. Lastly, the DRA
score are all of the numbers that you entered from 1-10 on the seven questions added together. This score will allow
you to see overall how good your day was with a 70 being perfect and a 7 being the worst possible. You can click
on the title and be redirected to a page that contains the entry title, entry, and date. You can adjust the height of
the textarea.

There is a button on the bottom of every page of the app. This button alerts you with contact information. For the
sake of the project the button prompts you with test@gmail.com.

You can logout with the button on the top right of the screen.

You can log back in by entering in you username and password.

You journal and answer the questions as many times as you want and as frequently as you wish.

To nagigate the site, use the navigation bar. Journal50 will take you home, Journal will take you to the journal route,
and history will take you to the history route.
